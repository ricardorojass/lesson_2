Given a collection of integers.

Iterate through the collection one by one.
  - save the first value as the starting value.
  - for each iteration, compare the saved value with the current value.
  - if the saved value is greater, or it's the same
    - move to the next value in the collection
  - otherwise, if the current value is greater
    - reassign the saved value as the current value

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 1
SET saved_number = value within numbers collection at space 1

WHILE iterator < length of numbers
  SET current_number = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"
  IF saved_number >= current_number
    go to the next iteration
  ELSE
    saved_number = current_number

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT saved_number

END

def find_greatest(numbers)
  saved_number = nil

  numbers.each do |num|
    saved_number ||= num  # assign to first value
    if saved_number >= num
      next
    else
      saved_number = num
    end
  end

  saved_number
end
